                    <h2>The Problem:</h2>
                    <p>Elissa is an aspiring art director who built her own website using Bootstrap when she was in college. She didn't feel like the website that she had created was a good reflection of who she was as an artist and as a person. She felt it looked too much like a typical out-of-the box Bootstrap website.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img class="img-work-page img-responsive" src="./img/Elissa/Elissa-old-website.PNG" alt="Old Website">
                        <figcaption>Generic Bootstrap Website that did not reflect her personality.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Our goal was to rebuild her website to reflect her personality and effectively showcasing her work. Bootstrap is very customizable, so I decided to leverage Bootstrap and write custom styling that extended the framework beyond its default look.
                    </p>
                    <h2><a id="sketching"></a>Sketching:</h2>
                    <p>I drew some sketches to brainstorm how the website should be re-structured to improve information architecture, navigation, and interface design.</p>
                     <figure>
                        <img class="img-work-page img-responsive" src="./img/Elissa/elissa-sketch.png" alt="Sketches">

                        <img class="img-work-page img-responsive" src="./img/Elissa/elissa-sketch2.png" alt="Sketches">
                        <figcaption>Site Information Architecture.</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                        <img class="img-work-page img-responsive" src="./img/Elissa/elissa-sketch3.png" alt="Sketches">
                        <figcaption>About Page Sketch.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>I regularly got feedback from Elissa so that we could iterate on these early sketches and come up with something that made sense.</p>
                    
                    <h2><a id="code-prototyping"></a>Code Prototyping:</h2>
                    <p>At this point, I jumped right into prototyping the project with HTML and CSS. Elissa wanted to get regular feedback so that she could help mould the site as it took its initial shape. I made the decision to skip over mockups because Elissa and I had worked together before, and I knew we could save time by working from a code prototype. I built custom classes to handle navigation and layout, and I re-wrote most of the HTML to accomodate the new architecture of the website.</p>
                    <h2><a id="branding"></a>Branding &amp; Visual Design:</h2>
                     <figure>

                        <figcaption></figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Since this was a personal website, I worked closely with Elissa to establish how the website should look. She wanted the softness and approachability of lower-case letters and pastel purples and blues. When she designed a new logo, I integrated the colors of the logo into the grid of projects. I used one of the purple colors throughout the website for links.</p>
                    <h2><a id="implementation"></a>Implementation:</h2>
                    <p>I continued to refine the design of the website with a focus on making it responsive and easy to use.</p>
