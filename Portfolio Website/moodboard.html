                    <h2>The Problem:</h2>
                    <p>Moodboards traditionally have a very flat hierarchy where all the pictures are given equal visual importance. I wanted to create a moodboard tool where the importance of a picture to the overall feel of the moodboard determined it's size.</p>
                    <p>Goals: The tool itself had to be visually quiet and understated, so that the contents of each moodboard would stand out. It also had to have functionality to encourage collaboration between team members. Images must resize gracefully with minimal disruption to the surrounding images.
                    </p>
                    <h2><a id="sketching"></a>Sketching:</h2>
                    <p>I generated a large volume of sketches to figure out how the moodboard would be laid out and how it would function.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img class="img-work-page img-responsive" src="/img/img-placeholder.PNG" alt="Sketches">
                        <figcaption>Sketches.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <h2><a id="wireframing"></a>Wireframing:</h2>
                    <p>The wireframing stage was very short. For wireframing to be useful, it needs to provide the designer with new information that sketching does not. The tool I used was very minimalistic, and it hindered my ability to make wireframes that told me anything new. If I were to do this project again, I would use a more robust Wireframing tool so I could have gotten more insights during this phase.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img class="img-work-page img-responsive" src="/img/img-placeholder.PNG" alt="Wireframes">
                        <figcaption>Main Screen Wireframe.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <h2><a id="branding"></a>Branding &amp; Visual Design:</h2>
                    <p>Worked to make the UI unintrusive. Chose a pleasant, undistracting color palette that was predominantly greys and blues. </p>
                    <figure>
                        <img class="img-work-page img-responsive" src="/img/img-placeholder.PNG" alt="Color Palette">
                        <figcaption>Color Palette</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        Designed the logo to be representative of the output of the tool. Many changes to branding and the styleguide occured even into the mockup phase as I worked on the real UI.
                        <figure>
                            <img class="img-work-page img-responsive" src="/img/img-placeholder.PNG" alt="Logo Gif">
                            <figcaption>Logo Evolution</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        Had to redesign the logo to create something more even looking, because it brought an uneven-ness to some screens. No element of design exists in a vacuum. You can try to apply the Waterfally method to design, but it's just going to reduce the quality of the final product.</p>
                    <h2><a id="mockups"></a>High-Fidelity Mockups:</h2>
                    <p>Built the mockups with a focus on the whole process. Empty states, changing sizes, all the modal windows a user might want.</p>
                    <p>Tools Used: Illustrator, Photoshop, Pen &amp Paper, Wireframe.cc</p>
